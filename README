Polinax: A free site to explore popular government through direct democracy. This version includes a first verion of the laws app. Please join the discussion in http://groups.google.com/group/polinax.

Polinax is a web site written in Python and using the Django and Pinax
projects as a base. 

This version is a fork from Pinax's new-groups-app svn branch. I've rewrote
most of it, using design from James Tauber. and other

PINAX BASED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

projects/
    complete_project/   a complete sample Pinax project and templates
    basic_project/      a more basic starter Pinax project
    polinax/            currently includes the laws and notification apps
apps/
    external_apps/      external re-usable apps via svn:externals
    local_apps/         re-usable apps that aren't yet externalized
libs/
    external_libs/      contains external libraries
docs/                   documentation (using rst and sphinx; in progress)
fixtures/               test fixtures (in progress)

There is some path manipulation in manage.py to get this all to work. You'll
need to do something similar in your wsgi or mod_python configuration.

Note that if you already have an external app or external lib on the path,
you don't need to use the one we provide.

Things should just work out of the box. You can cd into project/polinax and
run ./manage.py syncdb and ./manage.py runserver to get running immediately.
