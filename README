polinax: a site for network based politics

Polinax is a web site written in Python and using the Django and Pinax
projects as a base. 

Import user profile that includes friends, avatars. etc and integrate with 
account.

This version is a fork from Pinax's new-groups-app svn branch. I've rewrote
most of it, using design from James Tauber.

PINAX BASED DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

projects/
    complete_project/   a complete sample project and templates
    basic_project/      a more basic starter project
    polinax/            currently includes only projects and tribes. 
apps/
    external_apps/      external re-usable apps via svn:externals
    local_apps/         re-usable apps that aren't yet externalized
libs/
    external_libs/      contains external libraries
docs/                   documentation (using rst and sphinx; in progress)
fixtures/               test fixtures (in progress)

There is some path manipulation in manage.py to get this all to work. You'll
need to do something similar in your wsgi or mod_python configuration.

Note that if you already have an external app or external lib on the path,
you don't need to use the one we provide.

Things should just work out of the box. You can cd into project/polinax and
run ./manage.py syncdb and ./manage.py runserver to get running immediately.
